The files described in the repository structure, which are not on GitHub can be provided on request. 

## Usage

**!** The scripts have only been tested on Linux, using Python 3.9.1.  

To run the scripts, we recommend cloning this repository and installing necessary dependencies in a virtual environment. Dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install all necessary requirements, including the English spaCy language model, the bash script `install_requirements.sh` shoud be used.
